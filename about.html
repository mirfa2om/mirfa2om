    <h2>About the Project</h2>

    <img src="ewec-project.png" alt="Project Overview Image" style="max-width:100%; border-radius: 6px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

    <p>
      Mirfa 2 Reverse Osmosis will become the UAE’s third largest low-carbon intensive RO plant once fully commercially operational.
    </p>

    <p>
      EWEC (Emirates Water and Electricity Company), a leading company in the integrated coordination of planning, purchasing, and supply of water and electricity across the UAE, announced the award for its Mirfa 2 Reverse Osmosis (M2 RO) Independent Water Project. The project for the development of the low-carbon intensive RO desalination plant was awarded to a consortium led by ENGIE. TAQA will invest equity and take on the majority share in the project, and a role in the Operations and Maintenance company. Following the award, the project’s Water Purchase Agreement (WPA) and the Shareholders Agreement (SHA) were signed between TAQA, ENGIE, and EWEC.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mirfa 2 Reverse Osmosis (M2 RO) Plant uses RO technology to produce and supply up to 120 million imperial gallons, equivalent to 550,000 cubic metres of potable water per day to EWEC under a 30-year O&M Agreement with Mirfa 2 RO Desalination Company.
    </p>

    <p>
      The M2 RO Water Plant is located adjacent to the existing Mirfa 1 Plant located at the Mirfa Complex five kilometers west of the town of Mirfa, about 100 kilometers southwest of the city of Abu Dhabi on the Arabian Gulf coast in UAE. The expected date for starting commercial operations of the plant is November 2025.
    </p>

    <p>
      The processes stages that make up the plant are: ❖ Sea water intake ❖ Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) ❖ Dual Media Pressure Filtration (DMPF) ❖ Cartridge Filtration (CF) ❖ Reverse osmosis Racks (RO) ❖ Chemical Treatment ❖ Limestone filtration ❖ Potable water storage/network ❖ Sludge treatment ❖ Utilities or auxiliary equipment
